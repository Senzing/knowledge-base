# Web components

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create
new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.
Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards
will work across modern browsers and can be used with any
JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.
